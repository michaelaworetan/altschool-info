            <p>
                My name is Aworetan Michael Ayodeji. I have a solid background in backend development using Node.js, 
                where I built and maintained server-side applications. My passion for backend engineering sparked a deep interest 
                in understanding how cloud technologies work and how they can optimize application scalability and performance.

            <h2>Why I Joined the Program</h2>
            <p>
                My growing interest in cloud computing inspired me to enroll in AltSchool Africa's Cloud Engineering program. 
                I wanted to bridge the gap between backend development and cloud infrastructure by learning to design, deploy, and manage 
                scalable and secure cloud-based systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                AltSchool's hands-on approach to teaching and its focus on industry-relevant skills made it the perfect choice for me. 
                This program will help me build expertise in cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure, setting me on a path to achieving my 
                career aspirations.
